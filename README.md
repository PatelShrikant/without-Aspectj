# without-Aspectj

- this is simple java code of simple operation of banking system 
- to run this code simple create a package with name "withoops"
- and add both of the file in package 
- run Customer.class 

In this code we will see that is every operation in banking we will be call a method of update account.so this function will call after every function,so it will take time complexity and space . to reduce this we will use  aspect-oriented programming (AOP) 

this is link of this same code using AOP
